# Introduction to PI Interface for GE FactoryTalk Batch

PI Interface for Rockwell FactoryTalk Batch is a scan-based interface that collects batch data from the Rockwell FactoryTalk system. It reads Event Journals (EVT files) and stores that data as event frames and elements in a PI Batch Database or a PI Asset Framework (PI AF) Database. 

The interface also collects associated batch data in the form of PI Tags and PI Batch properties.

In addition to collecting batch data, the interface populates the PI Point Database. 

PI Point creation, commonly known as tag creation and event population, is controlled by using tag templates. All modules, tags, tag aliases, and health tags are automatically created on the PI server. The Interface does not use the PI API Buffering Service, because batch and tag data is already buffered by the source historian databases. To maximize performance, the interface writes events to PI tags in bulk; that is, it writes all events per interface scan.

The flow of data in the interface is unidirectional: data can only be read from the specified data source and written to the PI Server.  This interface can read data from multiple batch data sources simultaneously.  By design, the interface does not edit or delete source data.
