# How to merge multiple source batches

To merge multiple source batches that have identical batch IDs, enable the Merge multiple source batches with same batch ID into one PI batch option on the Merge Setup tab of the PI Event Frame Interface Manager. To ensure that related batch IDs match, you can configure a batch ID mask that extracts a common substring from the incoming ID. The interface caches batches and, when it reads a new batch from the source, it checks its cache for a batch with a matching ID. If a match is found, the interface merges the batches. If no match is found in the cache, the interface creates a new batch. By default, the interface caches batches for one day. To configure the cache duration, go to the Time Settings tab and set the Cache time value. 

## Configure the batch ID for merging multiple data bases

To enable the interface to merge multiple incoming source batches into a single batch, you must ensure that the batch IDs are identical. To override the default batch ID that the interface reads from the data source, you can configure a batch ID mask that extracts a common substring of the incoming ID to be used as the batch ID. The mask must match a contiguous substring from the incoming batch ID (that is, you cannot define a mask that skips characters). To configure the mask using PI Event Frame Interface Manager as follows: on the Merge Setup tab, set the Batch ID mask field. Specify the mask using fixed text and the following wildcards

| Wildcard | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| # | Single digit numerical value, 0-9 |
| @ | Single alpha character, a-z, A-Z |
| ? | Any single symbol |
| ! | Repeat the previous mask symbol |
| * | Any set of symbols |
