# How batch data is stored

<!-- No edits -->

For storing batch data, batch interfaces supports PI AF event frames. 

For event frames, the interface represents equipment by creating PI AF assets. PI AF event frames and elements provide a highly flexible, general-purpose structure that enables you to define your asset model and event hierarchy as needed. It does not restrict the number of unit batches that can be active in the same unit at the same time.
