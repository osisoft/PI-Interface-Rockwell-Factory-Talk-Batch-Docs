# Installation

After ensuring that the target host and any supporting systems meet the <xref:BIF_SystemRequirements>, download the [!include[interface](../includes/product-short.md)] installer and run it to complete interface installation.

1. From the [OSIsoft Customer Portal](https://customers.osisoft.com), download the latest version of the [!include[interface](../includes/product-short.md)] installer.

1. Open the [!include[interface](../includes/product-short.md)] installer. Follow the directions on screen to complete installation.

    **Note:** If the installer prevents you from completing installation, verify that you meet the <xref:BIF_SystemRequirements>. Then restart installation.

**Result:** [!include[interface](../includes/product-short.md)] installs to [!include[interface](../includes/product-path.md)].

## What's next?

Configure an instance of the interface. See <xref:BIF_ConfigurationOverview>.
