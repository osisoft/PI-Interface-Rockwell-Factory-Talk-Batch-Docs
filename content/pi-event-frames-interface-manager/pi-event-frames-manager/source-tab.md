# Source tab

Configure the data sources that you want the interface to read. To add a data source, right-click the top **Sources** node and choose the **Add** option for the type of source you are configuring. After you add the first data source, all additional data sources must be the same type (event journal or SQL database).

You can configure the interface to collect real-time data from an OPC Alarms and Events server. If the interface loses connectivity to the specified OPC Alarms and Events server, it switches to the specified SQL server and continues to collect data until it is able to reconnect to the OPC Alarms and Events server.

To configure a DeltaV Event Chronicle (alarms & events) data source, you must specify mappings that ensure that process cell data is recorded correctly, because DeltaV Event Chronicle does not emit process cell information.
	
To use explicit logins for an SQL data source, ensure that the user running the interface and the user configuring the interface are the same user.
