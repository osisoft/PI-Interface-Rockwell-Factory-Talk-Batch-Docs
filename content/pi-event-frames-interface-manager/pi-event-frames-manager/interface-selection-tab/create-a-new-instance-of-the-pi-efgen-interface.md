Draft comment: SHORT DESCRIPTION: Explains how to create new instances of PI EFGen.
Draft comment: (nd 2013-05-15) It might be helpful at this point to explain why the user would want to create multiple instances of EFGEN.

1. 	Click **Add Interface**. A dialog window appears.
2. 	Select an interface to configure from the drop-down list. Click **Edit Service ID** to give uniqueness to the configuration instance, and provide an **Interface description** if needed.
3. 	Click **OK**. The Interface field displays the name of the PI EFGen instance that you created.
