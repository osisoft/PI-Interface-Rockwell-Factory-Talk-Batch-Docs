# Specific considerations for [!include[interface](../includes/interface-name.md)]

<!-- Requires customization for interface -->

The [!include[interface](../includes/interface-name.md)] is designed to be used with the GE FactoryTalk Batch Manufacturing Execution System (MES). 

The interface collects batch data, including manual phase steps (using tag and property templates) from historical and real-time data. This allows the resulting PI Batches and Event Frames to accurately reflect all steps within a process in the MES.
