# [!include[interface](../includes/product-long.md)]

<!-- Requires customization for interface -->

The [!include[interface](../includes/product-short.md)] is designed to be used with the Rockwell FactoryTalk Batch Execution System (BES). 

The interface collects batch data, including manual phase steps (using tag and property templates) from historical and real-time data. This allows the resulting PI Batches and Event Frames to reflect all steps within a process in the BES accurately.
