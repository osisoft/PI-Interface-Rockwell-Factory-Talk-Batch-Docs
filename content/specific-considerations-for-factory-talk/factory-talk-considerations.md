# Specific considerations for FactoryTalk Batch

The Rockwell FactoryTalk Batch interface is designed to be used with the Rockwell FactoryTalk Batch Manufacturing Execution System (MES). 

The interface collects batch data, including manual phase steps (using tag and property templates) from historical and real-time data. This allows the resulting PI Batches and Event Frames to accurately reflect all steps within a process in the MES.
