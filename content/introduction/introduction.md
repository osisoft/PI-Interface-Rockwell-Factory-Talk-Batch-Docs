# Introduction 

[!include[interface](../includes/interface-name.md)] [!include[version](../includes/version.md)] is an event-based interface that collects data from the FactoryTalk software used in advanced industrial applications. FactoryTalk systems manage formulas, automate plant floors, and leverage the integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used in the manufacture of specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and packaged goods, among other industrial uses.

[!include[interface](../includes/interface-name.md)] collects batch events from event journal files created by FactoryTalk, which are based on an OpenBatch technology using the latest Microsoft technologies for integrating industrial operations. For more information on batch interfaces, see <xref:BIF_HowBatchInterfacesWork>.
