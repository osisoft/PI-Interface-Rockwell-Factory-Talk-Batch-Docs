# Introduction

PI Interface for GE FactoryTalk Batch is an event-based interface designed to collect data from the FactoryTalkÂ® software used in advanced industrial applications. These systems manage formulas, automate plant floors, and leverage the integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used in the manufacture of specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and packaged goods, among other industrial uses.

The interface collects batch events from event journal files created by FactoryTalk, which are based on an OpenBatch technology using the latest Microsoft technologies for integrating industrial operations. For additional information on batch interfaces, see [How batch interfaces work]{xref:Howbatchinterfaceswork}.
