| --------- | ----------- |
| AF SDK | Microsoft .NET assembly that provides access to objects and features of PI Asset Framework. PI AF SDK is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems. |
| Interface node | A computer where a PI interface and its supporting files are installed. |
| PI API | A C-based application programming interface (API) library of functions that enable programs to access a local or remote PI Server across a network. |
| PI Collective | A PI Server configuration of multiple servers that act as a logical PI Server in your PI System to provide high availability (HA), disaster recovery, load distribution, and increased scalability. Each server in a collective is called a member of the collective. |
| PI SDK | The COM-based software development kit for PI System applications. The PI SDK is a set of programming libraries for development of Microsoft Windows client programs or interfaces that can communicate with most PI Server versions (3.2.357 and up) on any supported operating system. |
| PI Server Node | A computer on which PI Server programs are installed. |
| PI System Management Tools | A set of client-based programs to complete a wide variety of common administrative tasks on a PI Server. Also know by the acronym PI SMT. |
| PIHOME | PIHOME points to the folder defined by the PIHOME environment variable and is the directory in which most 32-bit client applications are installed. By default, PIHOME is c:\program files(x86)\pipc on 64-bit machines and c:\program files\pipc on 32-bit machines. "pipc" does not need to be in the name, but it is in the name by default. |
| PIHOME64 | PIHOME64 points to the folder defined by the PIHOME64 environment variable and is the directory in which most 64-bit client applications are installed. By default, PIHOME64 is c:\program files\pipc. |
| pipc.log | The file to which OSIsoft applications write informational and error messages. To view PI logs, use PI SMT. |
| Point | Any data stream that is stored by PI Archive Subsystem, together with its attributes. For example, a point can represent a flow rate from a meter, a controller's mode of operation, the batch number of a product, text comments from an operator, or the results of a calculation. Also called a "tag." |
| Service | A Windows program that runs in the background, without user interaction. To ensure that interfaces are restarted when the interface node is rebooted, configure interfaces to run as services. |
