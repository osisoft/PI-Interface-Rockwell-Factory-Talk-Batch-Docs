# Interface Selection tab

<!-- Static topic. No modifications usually required -->

The **Interface Selection** tab is where you select or add a new instance of an interface. Click **Interface Selection** in the left panel to display a drop-down menu from which you can choose an interface.
    
**Note:** PI Event Frames Manager defaults to the batch interface package with which it was installed. You will see the name of the default batch interface listed, along with the drop-down menu from which you can choose another installed instance.

To configure settings using PI Event Frames Manager, select the interface instance you want to configure, or add a new instance.

Once an interface instance is selected, the left panel of the PI Event Frames Manager displays tab options described in the following sections.

The **Interface Selection** tab also provides options to add or remove interface instances:

* Click **Add Interface** to create a new interface instance.
* Click **Remove Interface** to remove an interface instance.
